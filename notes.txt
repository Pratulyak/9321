//Comp9321 notes for 16s2
Main objective- Build web applications fully functioning.
Web applications: Requires greater degree of modeling and more sophisticated tools and a weel defined repeatbale process.

Three tier architecture: Presentation, presentation/business logic, data storage
  - essentially user interface application database.

Thin vs Fat client based architechture. Thin meaning only UI is client side or both UI
and application is on client side.


//Course Learning Outcomes:
-design and implement a complete web application from scratch
- identify and apply design pattersn
-apply techniques to increase the performacne and scalability of your application

Web essentials: clients, servers, communication

Basic internet protocols, TCP/IP the concepts of port based communication.
Also the connection based communication allowing for splitting up of data into packets

URL:

-Scheme - underlying protocol to be used
-Host[:port] - hostname or IP address of the web server. For HTTP, the default port is 80
-path - Path to resource from the root directory of the web server
-url-params - optional value pairs
-anchor - reference to a position

HTTP:
-request-response model for communicatiion
-format is dictated by HTTP
-stateless, each request-response pair is a separate interaction

HTTP Response (from server to browser):
-Composed of Status Line + Header + Body
-Status Line: 200 OK, 404 Not Found etc
-Header:Content-Type, Content-Language, Content-Length, Cache-control, etc.
-Body: body contains requested data, in specific MIME format

Common Gateway Interface(CGI):
-Allows a browser to initiate a request to run a program
-not a scalable solution for big applications(e-commerce)

PHP: An open-source technology. It comes with rich built-in functionality, such as file upload.
Servlets, Java Server Pages: Java's version of CGI
ASP.NET: Microsoft's answer to better CGI technology

==================Week 2========================

Servlets:

Different layers in an application

Presentation:
  -JSP,XSLT,CSS,HTML
Business Logic:
  -Java classes
Data Access Layer:
  -Data Access objects
Data Store:
  -RDBMS, OODBMS,XML database


Presentation layer:
HTML is a markup language which uses a set of markup tags that describe different document content.
  html -> describes an HTML document.
  head -> provides information about the document.
  title -> provides a title for the document.
  body -> describes the visible page content.
  h1 -> describes a heading.
  p -> describes a paragraph
Forms are used to collect user input
HTML <form> method attribute specifies how to send form-data
  -URL Variables get or HTTP post transaction Post

GET:appends form-data into the url in name and value pairs
*****Never send sensitive data using GET(visible in URL)****
    -can be used for query options such as google
POST:
    • Appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not
    shown in URL).
    • Has no size limitations.
    • Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked.


Static vs Dynamic web pages:

      Static:
        -Qucik to develop
        -Cheap to host
        -Cheap to develop

      Dynamic:
        -Much more functional website
        -Much easier to update
        -New Content brings people back to the site and helps in se
        -Slower/more expensive to develop and host
